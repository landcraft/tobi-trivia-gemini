    # --- SIMULATED LLM CALL AND SUPABASE INTERACTION ---
    # In a real scenario:
    # 1. You'd use a secure LLM client library (e.g., Google's Python client)
    # 2. Your actual LLM API key would be read from an environment variable (e.g., os.environ.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY'))
    # 3. You'd implement web scraping here if needed.
    # 4. You'd use the Supabase Python client to:
    #    - Fetch recent questions for repeat prevention.
    #    - Store the newly generated unique questions.
    #    - This ensures question history persists across sessions and is secure.

    # For demonstration, we'll echo a fixed structure or simulate a very basic LLM response
    # based on the frontend's prompt request.
    print(f"Backend received request for trivia generation with prompt:\n{prompt_content[:200]}...") # Print first 200 chars

    # This is a placeholder response that mimics what the LLM *would* return
    # if called from here. The frontend is still making the direct LLM call for now.
    # You would replace this with actual LLM API call and Supabase logic.
